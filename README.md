# Creator Custom Code Support Deep Dive Code
If you want to follow along with our [deep dive video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrwrZBBOiP8) you can copy and paste this final code into your own Creator project. Be sure to replace your own Firebase data in todos.js.

You will still have to follow along with the demo to add Directives and components, as well as add the Dependencies required, but this will contain all of the JavaScript code you need.
